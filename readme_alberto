1) The signatures file contains, signatures of each file that is backed up so that Duplicity can figure out which part of a file has changed. With that information it can upload only the missing part to complete a new backup set.
2) The manifest file contains a listing of all the files in the backup set and a SHA1 hash of each file, probably so Duplicity can tell very quickly whether a file has been changed or not since the last backup.
3) The volume files (vol1 and vol2) contain the actual file data. It appears that Duplicity volumes are at most 5MB. That's helpful during restores so the entire backup set does't not need to be downloaded to retrieve a single file. Duplicity will only download the volume containing that file.

# Verify
sudo GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETTINGS=~/.duplicity/credentials duplicity verify gdocs://aberralgonzalez@usal.es/trinitybu  ~/
## Para ver que archivos han cambiado: ... duplicity -v4 ...

# List Files in backup
sudo GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETTINGS=~/.duplicity/credentials duplicity list-current-files gdocs://aberralgonzalez@usal.es/trinitybu

# Restore
sudo GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETTINGS=~/.duplicity/credentials duplicity --file-to-restore  "file to restore" gdocs://aberralgonzalez@usal.es/trinitybu
"archivo"

sudo GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETTINGS=~/.duplicity/credentials duplicity --file-to-restore apt/sources.list gdocs://aberralgonzalez@usal.es/trinitybu
/home/user/sources.list

1) The path to the file that is to be restored is relative to the directory on which the backup set is based. So in the command above, apt/sources.list plus the directory on which we based our backup (/duplicity) equals /duplicity/apt/sources.list. It would not work to put /etc/apt/sources.list as the source path because the backup will not recognize /etc as a valid path.
2) Duplicity will not overwrite an existing file. Here's the output if a change is made to the script above to restore the file to /etc/apt/sources.list:
	Restore destination directory /etc/apt/sources.list already exists.
	Will not overwrite.
